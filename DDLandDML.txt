-----------------------------DDL (Data Definition Language) vs. DML (Data Manipulation Language) in SQL--------------------------------------

SQL is divided into different categories, and DDL and DML are two of them.

1️⃣ DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL is used to define, create, and modify the database schema (structure of tables, indexes, constraints, etc.).

   -> It does not manipulate actual data, only the structure of the database.
   -> Changes made using DDL are permanent (autocommit).

--> Common DDL Commands:

Command	           Description

CREATE	     Creates a new database, table, or index.
ALTER	     Modifies an existing table (add/remove columns, change data type, etc.).
DROP	     Deletes a table, database, or index.
TRUNCATE	 Removes all records from a table but keeps its structure.
RENAME	     Renames a table or column.

🔹 Example: Creating a table using DDL

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

🔹 Example: Modifying a table using DDL

-> ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Age INT;  -- Adds a new column
-> DROP TABLE Employees;  -- Deletes the table permanently


2️⃣ DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML is used to manipulate and interact with the data inside tables.

   -> It does not change the database structure, only the data.
   -> DML operations can be rolled back (not autocommitted by default).

Common DML Commands:

Command	       Description

SELECT	   Retrieves data from a table.
INSERT	   Adds new records to a table.
UPDATE	   Modifies existing records in a table.
DELETE	   Removes specific records from a table.

🔹 Example: Inserting data using DML

INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 50000.00);

🔹 Example: Updating data using DML

UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 55000 WHERE ID = 1;

🔹 Example: Deleting data using DML

DELETE FROM Employees WHERE ID = 1;

📌 Key Differences Between DDL and DML

Feature	                        DDL (Data Definition Language)	                    DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Purpose	                      Defines & modifies database structure	                 Manipulates data inside tables
Commands	                     CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE	                      SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Affects Data?	                   No (only structure)	                                 Yes (actual records)
Auto-commit?	                 Yes (changes are permanent)	                         No (can be rolled back)

🔥 Quick Summary

✅ DDL modifies database structure (tables, columns, constraints).
✅ DML modifies data inside tables (insert, update, delete).
✅ DDL is auto-committed, while DML can be rolled back using transactions.

DDL vs. DML in Simple Terms

Imagine a restaurant where you have a menu, tables, and food items. Think of SQL as the kitchen that manages everything!

1️⃣ DDL (Data Definition Language) – "Setting Up the Restaurant"

DDL is like setting up the restaurant itself. It decides what the tables, chairs, and menu will look like.

💡 Think of DDL as the construction team:

    CREATE – Building new tables and chairs
    ALTER – Adding or removing chairs from a table
    DROP – Destroying the entire table
    TRUNCATE – Cleaning the table completely but keeping it

🔹 Example:
If a restaurant needs a new menu, they create it:

CREATE TABLE Menu (ItemID INT, ItemName VARCHAR(50), Price DECIMAL(5,2));

Once you change the structure, you can’t undo it easily!


2️⃣ DML (Data Manipulation Language) – "Taking & Serving Orders"

DML is like the waiters taking orders, serving food, and updating orders. It deals with the actual food (data), not the tables or restaurant 
structure.

💡 Think of DML as the waiter handling customer orders:

    INSERT – Adding a new order to the table
    UPDATE – Changing an existing order
    DELETE – Removing an order

🔹 Example:
If a customer orders a burger, the waiter writes it down:

INSERT INTO Menu (ItemID, ItemName, Price) VALUES (1, 'Burger', 5.99);

If they change their mind and add extra cheese:

UPDATE Menu SET Price = 6.99 WHERE ItemName = 'Burger';

If they cancel the order:

DELETE FROM Menu WHERE ItemName = 'Burger';

🛑 Key Differences

Feature                          	DDL (Setting Up the Restaurant)	                       DML (Taking & Changing Orders)

What it does?	                  Changes the structure (tables, menu)	                 Changes the data (orders, prices)
Commands	                         CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE	                       INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT
Can be undone?	                       No (permanent changes)	                                Yes (can use ROLLBACK)

🎯 Quick Summary

    DDL = Changing the restaurant setup (tables, chairs, menu design).
    DML = Taking, updating, or cancelling customer orders (actual data inside tables).

💡 DDL changes are permanent, while DML changes can be reversed!
